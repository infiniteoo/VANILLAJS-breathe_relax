### About

A simple app that encourages the user to follow a regular breathing pattern to help reduce anxiety, relax and find some inner peace.  

The biggest takeway from this project was learning a little more about the power of CSS animation.

Animation wasn't really covered in my Boot Camp, so I jump at the opportunity to learn more about ```transform``` methods such as ``` rotate``` and ```scale``` that are animated with ```keyframes```.

Thanks again to the genius Brand Traversy and his wonderful YouTube channel Traversy Media.  When I find success one day it will be partially in thanks to this guy... even if he is a Red Sox fan.
